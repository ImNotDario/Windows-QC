Simple Windows mod.
# How to use:
Create a new windows flash drive, go to Sources, and copy over the qc folder in there.
Restart your computer and boot into the installer. Press `Shift+F10` then type in `cd X:\Sources\qc`.
Type in `install.bat`. You will be prompted if you want to install MBR or UEFI.
UEFI is recomended.
After it finishes, it will reboot. You will get booted into the Utilities.
# What Next?
Once the PostInstall starts up, it will finish up the setup. **WHEN PROMPTED TO PRESS A KEY, WAIT UNTIL THE BOOT STATUS CHANGES TO "Getting Ready", THEN PRESS**
Create an account. *(administrator)*
You will be booted into windows, but there is no explorer. Instead you will get the PostOOBE wizard. From there, you can apply some regedit tweaks, then add some accounts.
**WHEN YOU HAVE FINISHED USING THE POSTOOBE WIZARD, USE OPTION 3 TO FINISH SETUP!**
After it finished setup, it deletes postinstall, and then adds a bootstrapper to explorer.
